1. Start by asking: “Have you ever wanted to send a secret message?”

2. Hand out Caesar cipher wheels or a Caesar shift chart.

3. Explain Caesar cipher: each letter is shifted by a number (e.g., A → D with a shift of 3).

4. Practice together: encode “HELLO” using a Caesar shift of +3.

5. Give each group a pre-written encrypted message and challenge them to decode it.

6. Have students invent their own cipher (letter swaps, symbols, or made-up rules).

7. Trade ciphers with another group and try to decode each other's message.
