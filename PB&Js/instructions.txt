1. Watch this 7-minute PB&J video: https://youtu.be/cDA3_5982h8
2. Ask: “What does this teach us about how computers follow instructions?”
3. Transition to a paper airplane challenge:
   - Everyone writes down step-by-step instructions for folding an airplane (no building yet).
4. Trade papers with someone else, then follow their instructions and build the plane.
5. Now, each student builds their own best paper airplane, any way they want.
6. Write new, clearer instructions based on that airplane.
7. Switch again and follow someone else's new instructions.
8. Have a flight contest to see which airplane flies the farthest!
9. End with a reflection: What made some instructions clearer than others?
